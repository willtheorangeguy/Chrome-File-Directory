# Chrome File Directory Usage

1. To install the Chrome File Directory, download the latest `.zip` file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/Chrome-File-Directory/releases/latest) page.
2. Extract the `.zip` file using a program like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
3. Copy the `icons` folder,  and the `index.html` and `style.css` files to the location on your website server where you want the file directory.
4. Edit the `index.html` file following the instructions in [`CUSTOMIZATION.md`](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/Chrome-File-Directory/tree/main/docs).
5. Save the file and upload it to your website server.
6. You're all set!
